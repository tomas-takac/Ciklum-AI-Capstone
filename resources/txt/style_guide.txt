6. FORMAT: Use short paragraphs or bullet points for readability.

EXAMPLE OF AN IDEAL POST:
I’m excited to share the AI Agent I developed as my capstone project for the Ciklum AI Academy!
This system is a RAG-based agent designed to analyze technical repositories and generate professional documentation.
I built it using a Python-based stack featuring LangChain for orchestration and Ollama for local LLM inference.
The core of the system uses a vector database to retrieve context from both PDF guidelines and source code.
This journey has been a deep dive into agentic reasoning and self-reflection workflows.
I’m grateful to @Ciklum for the support throughout this transformative learning experience!
