Haha, it happens to the best of us! It’s the "ignore-ance" trap. Here is the breakdown to get your Ciklum AI Academy Capstone repo clean and your Docker image lean.

1. .gitignore
Purpose: Keeps the junk out of GitHub. This prevents the 400MB of library files and the database from being uploaded.

Plaintext
# Virtual Environment
.venv/
venv/
ENV/
env/

# Local Database (Chroma)
my_rag_db/

# Python junk
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Mac system files
.DS_Store

# User-specific environment variables
.env
2. .dockerignore
Purpose: Keeps the junk out of the Docker Image. This makes your rag-app build faster and smaller.

Plaintext
# Don't copy the local database (it should be built fresh)
my_rag_db/

# Don't copy your local Mac virtual environment
.venv/
venv/

# Don't copy git history into the container
.git/
.gitignore

# Don't copy system files
.DS_Store

# Don't copy the README or diagrams into the running app
README.md
architecture.mmd
