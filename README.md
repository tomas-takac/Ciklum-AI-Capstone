# 🤖 Ciklum AI Academy Capstone: Agentic RAG System

This project is the final assignment for the **Ciklum AI Academy Engineering Track**. It represents the development of an **AI-Agentic system** designed to cover 80-90% of the core components involved in modern AI agent development.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The objective is to build an autonomous system capable of:
* **Reasoning & Reflection:** Analyzing decisions and self-correcting performance.
* **Information Retrieval:** Using a robust RAG pipeline (Embeddings + Vector Store).
* **Tool-Based Actions:** Taking meaningful actions based on autonomous reasoning.
* **Self-Contextualization:** Analyzing its own repository and construction to explain its functionality.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
The system uses a flexible, functional stack focused on reasoning and inspection:
* **Core Logic:** Python
* **Orchestration:** LangChain
* **Local LLM:** Ollama (Llama3)
* **Vector Database:** ChromaDB
* **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker Compose



## 🧠 Agentic Workflow
This system implements the following major stages of agentic development:

1.  **Data Preparation & Contextualization:** The agent indexes the Capstone PDF, its own source code (`.py`), and configuration files to understand its purpose and build process.
2.  **RAG Pipeline:** Information is retrieved using a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` and `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings stored in Chroma.
3.  **Autonomous Reasoning:** The agent evaluates user queries against retrieved technical context to draft LinkedIn posts.
4.  **Self-Reflection Loop:** The agent reviews its own drafts against a `style_guide.txt` to ensure it meets the 5-7 sentence requirement and professional tone.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Docker and Docker Desktop installed.

### Installation & Execution
1. Create a PDF from the capstone project description. First PDF in `resources/pdf` folder is processed. 
2. Ensure your `style_guide.txt` and `resources/pdf/` are in the project root.
3. Make the scripts executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x start.sh setup_ollama.sh
    ```
4. Launch the system:
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```
    *Note: The first run will automatically pull the Llama3 model via `setup_ollama.sh`.*

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria Met
* **Functionality:** The agent successfully analyzes its own repository.
* **Relevance:** The agent clearly references its context within the **Ciklum AI Academy**.
* **Reasoning:** Demonstrated through the self-reflection and correction loop.

## 📁 Deliverables
1.  **Git Repository:** Source code and documentation.
2.  **Architecture Diagram:** See `architecture.mmd`.
3.  **Demo Video:**
4.  **LinkedIn Post:** Generated by the agent, explaining its build process and Ciklum context.
